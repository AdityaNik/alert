### Committing

We are applying [conventional commits] here.
In short, that means a commit has to be one of the following types:

- **feat**: A new feature.
- **fix**: A bug fix.
- **docs**: Documentation-only changes.
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
- **test**: Adding missing or correcting existing tests.
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries,
  such as documentation generation

and avoid including unrelated commits.

After you have submitted your pull request,
we'll try to get back to you as soon as possible.
We may suggest some changes or improvements.
